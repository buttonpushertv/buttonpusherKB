A set of files used to create an efficient Post-Production Keyboard Interface that works for me.

 Based on the [2nd keyboard:https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard] project by TaranVH, this suite of [AutoHotKey] scripts (and a few other files) provide a framework for making efficient use of a keyboard and some other input devices for the work I do in post-production.
 
 A little about me: Iâ€™m an editor with over 30 years experience in post-production. I got my start in linear, tape-based suites and quickly transitioned to non-linear systems as the field evolved. Iâ€™m a nut for tweaking the interface of my systems. In recent years, Iâ€™ve begun integrating custom and programmable keypads and other devices into my workflow.
 
 The scripts here represent a destination, of sorts, for this journey Iâ€™ve been on for years. The combination of apps like AutoHotKey, flexible programmable devices like Elgatoâ€™s StreamDeck, and fully-programmable keyboards (and keypads) have allowed me to raise the level of customization very high. This is way, way, beyond changing some keys in Premiere Pro.

Before you dive into this, please be aware that this is super complex. Iâ€™ve put a lot of thought into all this. While Iâ€™ve tried (and will keep trying) to document and explain what & why Iâ€™ve built things the way I have, I donâ€™t know if anyone would want to just take my system and drop it into their own workflow. I present it all here, in its open-source glory so you can pull out the bits that you want for yourself.

Finally, while I know and have learned enough about AutoHotKey to be dangerous, I am *not* a programmer. Iâ€™m certain that I have coded some of this stuff in some stupid ways. I guess thatâ€™s also why Iâ€™ve put it all here on Github, so that I can refine it and make it better. For the most part,  it works for me, so Iâ€™m ok with the code not being perfectly optimized.

One last thing: this whole suite only works on Windows systems. Eventually I will adapt this effort for OSX (using Keyboard Maestro most likely, but of course thereâ€™s always HammerSpoon...). I use both platforms pretty regularly, so it will happen *eventually*.

Now, on with the show...

## Getting Started

To make use of this suite, there are just a few things youâ€™ll need to do.

1.  Install [AutoHotKey] - download & install the latest stable version.
2.  Download this whole repository and unzip it into a folder in the root of your system drive. Mine is located in C:\BPTV-KB. I have it installed on 3 systems and the only thing that I have to tweak on each system is the settings.ini file (more on that later)
3.  Thatâ€™s pretty much all you need to get going...well, thereâ€™s the whole *getting-inside-Benâ€™s-brain-thing* but other than that, youâ€™re all set. ðŸ˜œ

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
