These items are stand-alone Apps (as opposed to scripts) that help do a thing.

Here are links to the apps I use that are .gitignored from this folder:

VNCHelper (https://www.zhornsoftware.co.uk/vnchelper/)
Super helpful if you have several other machines on your network that you need to connect to on a regular basis. Useful for VNC but also for SMB connections as well.

Quick Access Popup (https://www.quickaccesspopup.com/)
Great shortcut pop-up menu. Get the portable version.

initool (https://github.com/dbohdan/initool)
Reading, writing, manipulating INI files/items from command line
