#WinActivateForce ;this may prevent taskbar flashing, and force a window to open instead, as it should.

;rather than pointing ALL the individual scripts directly to Almost_All_Windows_Functions.ahk, I'm pointing them all to THIS redirect file, which in turn points to Almost_All_Windows_Functions.ahk.
