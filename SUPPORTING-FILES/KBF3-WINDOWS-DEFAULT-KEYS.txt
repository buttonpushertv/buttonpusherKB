Windows 10 Keyboard Shortcuts

Windows         Show the Windows 10 Start Menu

Windows + A     Open Windows 10 notifications
Windows + D     Show Windows desktop
Windows + E     Open Windows Explorer
Windows + G     Opens the Windows 10 Game Bar
Windows + H     Share content (if supported by current app)
Windows + I     Open Windows 10 settings
Windows + K     Connect to wireless displays and audio devices
Windows + L     Lock your Windows 10 device
Windows + P     Project a screen
Windows + Q     Search the web and Windows with Cortana (speech)
Windows + R     Run a command
Windows + S     Search the web and Windows with Cortana (keyboard input)
Windows + X     Open Start button context menu
Windows + [1,2,3...]Open programs that are pinned to task bar
                    E.g. if first pinned program on your task bar is Windows Explorer (from left to right), the shortcut Windows + 1 opens Windows Explorer for you.

Windows + Space     Switch keyboard input language (if you have added at least a second one)
Windows + Tab       Launch Windows 10 Task View

Windows + Shift + [Left][Right]     Move current Window from one monitor to another (when using a multiple monitor setup)
Windows + [Left][Right][Up][Down]   Position windows on your screen
                                    E.g. Windows + [Left] moves the current window to the left half of your screen.
                                    If you use Windows + [Up] afterwards, the current window will be placed in the upper left quarter of your screen.
                                    And, what’s very handy in my opinion: If you release the Windows key after positioning a window,
                                    Task View shows up on the opposite side of the positioned window to select and position another app.

Windows + Ctrl + D                  Create new virtual desktop
Windows + Ctrl + [Left][Right]      Switch between virtual desktops
Windows + Ctrl + F4                 Close current virtual desktop

Alt + Tab       Switch to previous window
Alt + Space     Restore, move, size, minimize, maximize or close current window. Also works like a charm for Windows 10 modern apps.
                (If you run 'Launchy' this function is replaced)
Alt + F4        a) Close current window
                b) If you’re on your Windows 10 desktop, open Power dialogue to shut down or restart Windows, put your device in sleep mode, sign out or switch the current user
