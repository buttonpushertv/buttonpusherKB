;;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++;;

;; You should DEFINITELY not be trying to add a 2nd keyboard unless you're already
;; familiar with how AutoHotkey works. I recommend that you at least take this tutorial:
;; https://autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm

;; You should probably use something better than Notepad for your scripting. (Do NOT use Word.)
;; I use Notepad++. "Real" programmers recoil from it, but it's fine for my purposes.
;; https://notepad-plus-plus.org/
;; You'll probably want the syntax highlighting:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45466733/autohotkey-syntax-highlighting-in-notepad

;;COOL BONUS BECAUSE YOU'RE USING QMK:
;;The up and down keystrokes are registered seperately.
;;Therefore, your macro can do half of its action on the down stroke,
;;And the other half on the up stroke. (using "keywait,")
;;This can be very handy in specific situations.
;;The Corsair K55 keyboard fires the up and down keystrokes instantly.

;;===================== MODIFIERS =========================;;

;Lshift::tooltip, Even if you used the "F22_with_modifiers" hex file, these woudn't be wrapped unless you were already holding down some OTHER key. hmm.
;If you DID use F24.hex, then these won't get pressed in the first place.
;Lctrl::tooltip, do not use
;Lwin::tooltip, do not use
;Lalt::tooltip, do not use

;Ralt::tooltip, do not use
;Rwin::tooltip, do not use
;appskey::tooltip, This is not a modifier, but I replaced it with INTERNATIONAL4 (SC079) anyway, because it was able to misbehave.
;Rctrl::tooltip, do not use
;Rshift::tooltip, do not use


;;If you leave the modifier keys alone, it allows for lines like the ones below:
;+z::tooltip, you pressed SHIFT Z on the F24 keyboard.
;^z::tooltip, you pressed CTRL Z on the F24 keyboard.
;!z::tooltip, you pressed ALT Z on the F24 keyboard. I don't recommend this... ALT is dangerous because of menu acceleration, even if you try to disable it like I have
;^!z::tooltip, you pressed CTRL SHIFT Z on the F24 keyboard.
;;Etc.
;;However, I use few to no modifiers on my secondary keyboards... I prefer tap dance instead. The decision is up to you.
;;If you're super confused by all this, don't be. Just use F24.hex and don't worry about the modifiers at all.
;;Also, I have to do some more testing to see if the stuff I said above is actually true, hmmmmmm.


;;================= MODIFIERS REMAPPED ======================;;

;; When you replace these with your own functions, I recommend that you do NOT delete the tooltips. Just comment them out. That way, you always know what was changed to what. It gets very confusing very quickly otherwise.
;; Here is the full list of scan code substitutions that I made:
;; https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSj0gKDxyWAecB3SIyEZ2ssPETZkkxn67gdIwL1zFUs/edit#gid=824607963

SC070::tooltip, [F24] Lshift -to-> SC070-International 2

;; The following 3 assignments MUST use the UP stroke - the down stroke doesn't appear for some reason.
SC071 up::tooltip, [F24] LCtrl -to-> SC071-Language 2
SC072 up::tooltip, [F24] LWin -to-> SC072-Language 1
SC073 up::tooltip, [F24] LAlt -to-> SC073-International 1
; The above 3 assignments MUST up the UP stroke

SC077::tooltip, [F24] RAlt -to-> SC077-Language 4
SC078::tooltip, [F24] RWin -to-> SC078-Language 3
SC079::tooltip, [F24] AppsKey -to-> SC079-International 4
SC07B::tooltip, [F24] RCtrl -to-> SC07B-International 5
SC07D::tooltip, [F24] RShift -to-> SC07D-International 3

;;================= LOCKING KEYS ======================;;

F20::tooltip, [F24] CapsLock -to-> SC06B-F20
SC05C::tooltip, [F24] NumLock -to-> SC05C-International 6
;Numlock is an AWFUL key. I prefer to leave it permanently on.
;It's been changed to International 6, so you can use it with no fear that it'll mess up your numpad.
;;ScrollLock is in the next section.

;;================= NEXT SECTION ======================;;

PrintScreen::tooltip, [F24] %A_thishotKey%
ScrollLock::tooltip, [F24] %A_thishotKey% ;ScrollLock is not so troublesome. I left it alone.
SC07E::tooltip, [F24] Pause -to-> SC07E-Brazillian comma

;;Don't use the 3 keys below for your 2nd keyboard!
;Pause::msgbox, The Pause/Break key is a huge PITA. That's why I remapped it to SC07E
;Break::msgbox, Or is it THIS key? WHO KNOWS!
;CtrlBreak::msgbox, I have no idea what Ctrlbreak is. But it shows up sometimes.
;;Don't use the 3 keys above for your 2nd keyboard! Just don't!!

; which corresponded to some of the super function keys. (F13-F24)

; You don't have the option to NOT wrap them, unless you make your own hex file.

#if ;this line will end the F24 secondary keyboard assignments.


;;;---------------IMPORTANT: HOW TO USE #IF THINGIES-------------------

;;You can use more than one #if thingy at a time, but it must be done like so:
#if (getKeyState("F24", "P")) and if WinActive("ahk_exe Adobe Premiere Pro.exe")
F1::msgbox, You pressed F1 on your secondary keyboard while inside of Premiere Pro

;; HOWEVER, You still would still need to block F1 using #if (getKeyState("F24", "P"))
;; If you don't, it'll pass through normally, any time Premiere is NOT active.
;; Does that make sense? I sure hope so. Experiment with it if you don't understand.

;; Alternatively, you can use the following: (Comment it in, and comment out other instances of F1::)
; #if (getKeyState("F24", "P"))
; F1::
; if WinActive("ahk_exe Adobe Premiere Pro.exe")
; {
	; msgbox, You pressed F1 on your secondary keyboard while inside of Premiere Pro
	; msgbox, And you did it by using if WinActive()
; }
; else
	; msgbox, You pressed F1 on your secondary keyboard while NOT inside of Premiere Pro
;;This is easier to understand, but it's not as clean of a solution.
